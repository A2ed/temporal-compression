The study looks at the timecourse of mental simulations that are operationalized as imagined movement through a city. The central idea of the paper is that environmental representations are encoded in neural indices in the hippocampus, and that the recapitulation of the neural indices that code a specific route through the environment are dynamic. That is, there is not a one-to-one mapping of encoded patterns of neural activity and those that occur when the memory is reinstated and used.

To test this, we look at variation in the speed of encoding representations and how well environmental features from memory are integrated during mental simulations. For encoding, our reasoning was that if simulations are simple replay events and are not dynamic, then the timecourse of a simulation should match the timecourse of the event it was based on. However, there is incentive for the brain to allow simulations to be dynamic, in that they can be used for prospection where trade offs between the amount of information you can simulate and the resolution of that information occur. We found that that all simulations were temporaly compressed, but that the brain was able to change the compression rate to optimize this trade off.

For integration of features during simulation, we operationalized this process based on the visual qualities of a mental simulation that occur internally to an individual. We found that more vivid and spatially coherent simulations were faster, indicating that (1) the memory trace/neural index is not a static entity but is dynamic and therefore malliable, and (2) that processes occur during feature integration that allow certain memories to be optimized.
